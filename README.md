Thanks for downloading one of my fonts! My fonts are free for non-commercial use... but donations are always accepted! Email me if you are interested in sending a donation. Of course you don't have to. If you want to use this font commercially, please contact me at one of the addresses above, and we'll talk about it... Okay? If you plan to use them non-commercially, the only thing that I ask is please let me know where you use them... I'm curious as to see how they'll look, because I'm new at this fontmaking stuff. You may distribute my fonts through any media, as long as you don't ask money for them and you don't claim them as your own. Other than that, do whatever you want! Also, check on the webpage every so often for any new fonts or new versions (although I don't plan on redoing any fonts unless I absolutely have to.) That's it!


"Dreamwish" is another lullaby-type font. It looks best when stars are put between the letters. The different stars are 0-9.

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex).

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and page routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking accessible UI
- [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) for authentication

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase and didn't use `npm create convex`, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you're reading this README on GitHub and want to use this template, run:

```
npm create convex@latest -- -t nextjs-convexauth
```
